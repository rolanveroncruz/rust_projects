# hdllo_world
In this project, we start out with a hello world.

## Learnings
1. The entry function is the `main` function. In this case, it takes no parameters and returns nothing.
2. Although rust style is to use 4 spaces and not a tab, it doesn't seem to mind.
3. `println!` is a macro, not a function. Using a `!` means you're calling a macro and not an ordinary/normal function,
4. End statements using a semicolon `;`.
